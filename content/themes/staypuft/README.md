## FAQ

1. **Where should I report issues or request a new feature?**

  The appropriate place to report issues or request new features is the [Issues section](https://github.com/dlecina/StayPuft/issues).

2. **Where should I discuss other topics?**

  To discuss other topics, please find an appropriate post in my blog's [Staypuft tag](http://davidlecina.com/blog/tag/staypuft/) and post a comment there.

3. **How can I disable comments?**

  To disable comments, simply remove the line `{{> "post-comments"}}` from `post.hbs` and `page.hbs`. You do not need `disqus.hbs` in this case.

4. **How can I disable comments only on pages?**

  To disable comments only on pages, simply remove the line `{{> "post-comments"}}` from `page.hbs`.

5. **How do I use Syntax Highlighting with Markdown?**

  See the [Syntax highlighting demo](http://davidlecina.com/blog/prism-demo/).

## Development

StayPuft styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need Node, Yarn and Gulp installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

You can keep Ghost running in your [local development environment](https://docs.ghost.org/docs/install-local) by running this from Ghost's root directory:

```bash
nodemon current/index.js --watch content/themes/StayPuft --ext hbs,js,css
```
